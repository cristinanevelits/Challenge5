# Challenge5
Challenge 5, Module 5, Berkeley BootCamp.

## Description: 

- Updated the script.js code in order to meet all functionality needed:
- The code is using Day.js format.
- It checks if the hour is exactly equal to 12. If so, it displays "12PM" because 12:00 PM is noon.
- If the hour is less than 12 (before noon), it displays "AM" for all hours from 1 AM to 11 AM.
- If the hour is greater than 12 (after noon), it subtracts 12 from the hour to convert it to the 12-hour format and appends "PM." This covers hours from 1 PM to 11 PM.
- You can save events for each hour of the day by entering text into the time block and clicking the save button.
