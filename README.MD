# Challenge5
Challenge 5, Module 5, Berkeley BootCamp.

## Description: 
First challenge of the BootCamp:

- refactored code in html and css focusing on accessibility.
- for html: changed the title, created new semantic elements, made sure elements follow logical structure, added alt attributes to img, made sure heading elements are sequential. 
- for css: refactored the css code after changing the html in order for the web page to look identical to before.
-added relevant comments describing every step of the process I did within this project as well as all the changes made for the page to look the same as the mockup.
